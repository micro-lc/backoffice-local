# Caching

## back-kit

Back-kit has no server-side cache on the nginx reverse proxy. To activate it (if no version update of back-kit is needed)
please comment cache directives on [nginx config file](../reverse-proxy/conf/nginx.conf) as hinted by the following snippet

```nginx
# back-kit
location /back-kit {
    rewrite                         /back-kit/(.*) /$1 break;
    index                           index.html;
    include                         /etc/nginx/includes/proxy.conf;
    proxy_pass                      http://back-kit:8080;

    # kill cache
